```

## Infromation

### Functions

Many types of functions are included in the package:

1\. `sim` functions: they are mainly written to perform analysis on
    individual simulation files/file.

2\. `ens` functions: they are mainly written to perform analysis on
ensemble files/file.

3\. `clima` functions: they are mainly written to perform analysis of
climate projections used in agricultural simulations.


### Production
